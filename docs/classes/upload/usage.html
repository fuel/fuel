        <h2>Upload Class</h2>

        <p>
            The upload class allows to securely process files that have been uploaded to the application.
            It allows you to filter uploads in various ways, define what the destination filenames should look like, or filter on size or length of the filename.
        </p>

        <h3>Uploaded files array</h3>

        <p>Information of every uploaded file is stored in a multidimensional array within the Upload class.
            For every file, an array is defined with the following fields:
        </p>

        <table class="config">
            <tbody>
                <tr class="header">

                        Mime-type of the file uploaded, as determined by the Upload class.
                        Note that this requires an up-to-date 'mime magic' file to be installed.
                        This file is present on every *nix platform, but on Windows platforms, you might have to install this file yourself.
                        If the mime-type can not be determined, this field contains the same value as 'type'.

                        The error detected when uploading the file or when validating the uploaded file. If zero, there were no errors.

        <p>
            Note that mime-type will always contain the most specific type. So if the browser claims it's an MS-Word document, but the mime-type
            is determined as being "application/octet-stream", the browser's mime-type is used, even if this may be wrong or unexpected!
            For example, a Microsoft .xlsx file might be detected as being "application/zip".
        </p>

        <p>
            After you have called the save() method, this array structure is expanded with two extra fields, giving you information about what was actually saved.

            <p>
                If you want to use a 'validate' callback, be sure to register it before you call Upload::process().
                If you have used the 'auto_process' configuration setting, Upload::process() will be called as soon as you use the Upload class,
                which means you will have to call it again after you have defined the callback.
            </p>
            <p>
                The callback will receive an entry from the uploaded files array as parameter. The entry is passed by reference, which allows
                the callback function to modify the entries of the array.<br />
                If the callback function returnes an integer, it is assumed to be an update of the uploaded file's error code.
                All other return values are ignored.
