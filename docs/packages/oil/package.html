		<h2>Oil utility</h2>

		<p>The Oil utility is a special package command can be used in several ways to facilitate quick development, help with
		testing your application and for running <a href="../../general/tasks.html">Tasks</a>.</p>

		<section>

			<h2>Package</h2>

			<p>
				Packages can be installed and downloaded manually but with the help of the package command it can work much quicker. It does this
				by looking for packages within a list of sources defined in <kbd>fuel/core/package.php</kbd> and like any other config file can
				be edited there or copied to the <kbd>fuel/app/config</kbd> folder.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Oil is smart, so it will check to see if you have Git installed on your computer before it does anything with the package command.
				If you do have Git installed Oil will install a package as a Git repository instead of directly downloading the files, meaning
				updates, new releases and tracking custom changes to packages could not be easier.
			</p>
