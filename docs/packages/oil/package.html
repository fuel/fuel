        <h2>Oil utility</h2>

        <p>The Oil utility is a special package command can be used in several ways to facilitate quick development, help with
        testing your application and for running <a href="../../general/tasks.html">Tasks</a>.</p>

        <section>

            <h2>Package</h2>

            <p>
                Packages can be installed and downloaded manually but with the help of the package command it can work much quicker. It does this
                by looking for packages within a list of sources defined in <kbd>fuel/core/package.php</kbd> and like any other config file can
                be edited there or copied to the <kbd>fuel/app/config</kbd> folder.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Oil is smart, so it will check to see if you have Git installed on your computer before it does anything with the package command.
                If you do have Git installed Oil will install a package as a Git repository instead of directly downloading the files, meaning
                updates, new releases and tracking custom changes to packages could not be easier.
            </p>
