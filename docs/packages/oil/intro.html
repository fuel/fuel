			<p>Oil is an optional command line utility designed to help speed up development by providing several functions:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="../../packages/oil/generate.html">Generate</a> - Build MVC components, migrations and entire scaffolding.</li>
				<li><a href="../../packages/oil/refine.html">Refine</a> - Run tasks such as migrate and your own custom ones.</li>
