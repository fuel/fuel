## Description

Fuel is a fast, lightweight PHP 5.3 framework. In an age where frameworks are a dime a dozen, We believe that Fuel will stand out in the crowd.  It will do this by combining all the things you love about the great frameworks out there, while getting rid of the bad.

##Development Team

* Dan Horrigan - Lead Developer ([http://dhorrigan.com](http://dhorrigan.com))
* Phil Sturgeon - Developer ([http://philsturgeon.co.uk](http://philsturgeon.co.uk))
* Jelmer Schreuder - Developer ([http://jelmerschreuder.nl/](http://jelmerschreuder.nl/))
* Harro Verton - Developer ([http://wanwizard.eu/](http://wanwizard.eu/))

##Requirements

The planned requirements for Fuel are as follows:

* PHP 5.3 or greater
* Any web server

That's it! Nothing else.
