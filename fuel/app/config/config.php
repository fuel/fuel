		 * Basic Routing

		 * matched then the request is routed to the URI on the right.
		 *
		 * This allows you do do things like the following:
		 *
		 * 'about'		=> 'site/about',
		 * 'contact'	=> 'contact/form',
		 * 'admin'		=> 'admin/login',

		/**
		 * Slightly Advanced Routing
		 *
		 * You can include any regex into your routes.  The left side is matched against the
		 * requests URI, and the right side is the replacement for the left, so you can use
		 * backreferences in the right side from the regex on the left.  There are also a few
		 * special statements that allow you match anything, or just a segment:
		 *
		 * :any - This matches anything from that point on in the URI
		 * :segment - This matches only 1 segment in the URI, but that segment can be anything
		 *
		 * Here are some examples:
		 *
		 * 'blog/(:any)'		=> 'blog/entry/$1', // Routes /blog/entry_name to /blog/entry/entry_name
		 * '(:segment)/about'	=> 'site/about/$1', // Routes /en/about to /site/about/en
		 */

		/**
		 * Advanced Routing
		 *
		 * You can also have named parameters in your routes.  This allows you to give your URI segments
		 * names, which can then be accessed from within your actions.
		 *
		 * Example:
		 *
		 * 'blog/:year/:month/:id'	=> 'blog/entry', // Routes /blog/2010/11/entry_name to /blog/entry
		 *
		 * In the above example it would catch the following '/blog/2010/11/entry_name'.  It would then
		 * route that request to your 'entry' action in your 'blog' controller.  There, the named params
		 * will be available like this:
		 *
		 * $this->param('year');
		 * $this->param('month');
		 * $this->param('id');
		 */
		
		/**
		 * HTTP verb based routing
		 *
		 * You can route your URLs to controllers and actions based on the HTTP verb used to call them.
		 * This makes it quick and easy to make RESTful controllers.
		 *
		 * Example:
		 *
		 * 'blog' => array(array('GET', 'blog/all'), array('POST', 'blog/create')), // Routes GET /blog to /blog/all and POST /blog to /blog/create
		 *
		 * You can use named parameters and regexes within your URL just like normal:
		 *
		 * 'blog/(:any)' => array(array('GET', 'blog/show/$1'))
